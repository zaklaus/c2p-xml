# C2P-XML
Basic XML parser with support of nested and/or multiple nodes inside a XML document. 
Also supports node properties.

## Usage
Get the latest version of XML parser and look into main.cpp and/or source code of actual XML parser.

## Known Bugs
See Issues tab for information.

## Why do you update this after a long time?
I wanted to update this small parser to fit my coding style and support cross-platform builds. The fate of this parser would be either incorporating into DZMLang(see profile) or rewriting from scratch in C.
