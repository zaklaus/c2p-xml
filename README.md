#C2P-XML
Basic XML parser with support of nested and/or multiple nodes inside a XML document. 
Also supports node properties.

##Usage
Get latest version of XML parser and look into main.cpp and/or source code of actual XML parser. I don't have much time writing documentation, so it'll have to wait.
